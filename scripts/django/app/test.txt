dr. Martin Luther King jr. in a 1968 speech where he reflects upon the Civil Rights Movement states in the end we will remember not the words of our enemies
 but the Silence of our friends
 as a teacher I've internalized this message everyday all around us we see the consequences of Silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination violence genocide and War in the classroom I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives the Poetry we work together to fill those spaces to recognize and name them to understand that they don't have to be sources of Shame
 in an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe during the intimacy is of their own silences I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class which every student signs the beginning of the year
 read critically write consciously speak clearly tell your truth
 I find myself thinking a lot about that last Point tell your truth
 and I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the X Y I failed to do so
 do I tell them that growing up as a kid in a Catholic Family in New Orleans during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do with the give something up sacrifice something you typically indulgent to prove to God you understand it's sanctity I've given up soda McDonald's french fries french kisses and everything in between
 but one year
 I gave up speaking take in the most valuable thing I could sacrifice with my own voice but it was like I hadn't realized
 but I had given that up a long time ago I spent so much of my life telling people to things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still have to figure out how being my own so sometimes
 I just wouldn't say anyting appeasing ignorance with my silence underwear that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence when Christian was beat up for being gay I put my hands in my pocket and walk with my head down as if I didn't even notice couldn't use my locker for weeks because the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up really searching for an affirmation that he was worse things I was more concerned with touching the screen of my apple and actually feeding him one when the woman at the fundraising Gala to them so proud of you must be so hard to turn those poor unintelligent kids I bit my lip cuz apparently we needed her money with a my students needed their dignity we spend so much time
 listening to the things people are saying
 that we really pay attention to the things they don't
 silence is the residue of fear is feeling your flaws French Guillotine your tongue it is a are retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs silent is Rwandan Genocide silence is Katrina is what you hear when there aren't enough body back left it is a sound after the news is already tied it is charging the change in his privilege it is pain there is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision I will tell Christian that he is a lion a sanctuary of bravery and Brilliance I will at that homeless man what's his name is now we've day was because sometimes all people want to be if human I will tell that woman that my students to talk about transcendentalism like their last name was the road it just because you watch one episode of The Wire doesn't mean you know anything about my kids so this year
 instead of giving something up I will live everyday as if it were a microphone tucked under my tongue stays on the underside of my inhibition
 because you have to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed
 is your voice thank you
